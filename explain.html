      <h2>Qubits</h2>
      <h3>Classical Bits vs Qubits</h3>
      <p>The classical bits you’re likely familiar with can be either 0 or 1. A quantum bit, “qubit”, can uniquely exist in a combination of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows quantum systems to process information in ways that are impossible for classical computers. </p>
      
      <h3>Superposition </h3>
      <p> If a qubit is in a superposition, it means that it’s a linear combination of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Rather than being in one definite state, the qubit has a certain probability amplitude for each outcome until it is measured.</p>
    <h3>Phase and Amplitude</h3>
<p>Each component of a qubit’s state has both a magnitude (amplitude) and a relative phase. While amplitudes determine measurement probabilities, phase becomes crucial when qubits interact or interfere during quantum gates.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="superconducting" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>Superconducting Qubits as Circuits</h2>
      <h3>Josephson Junctions</h3>
      <p>Superconducting qubits are built using Josephson junctions, which are thin insulating barriers between superconducting materials. These junctions introduce nonlinearity, allowing the circuit to behave like a quantum two-level system.</p>
      <h3>Qubits as Nonlinear Oscillators</h3>
      <p>Unlike ordinary electrical oscillators, superconducting qubits have uneven energy spacing between levels. This allows us to isolate and control just the two lowest energy states, which correspond to |0⟩ and |1⟩.</p>
      <h3>Energy Levels |0⟩ and |1⟩</h3>
      <p>The |0⟩ and |1⟩ states correspond to different quantized energy levels of the circuit. Transitions between them are driven using precisely tuned microwave pulses.</p>
      <h3>Microwave Control Pulses</h3>
      <p>Quantum gates are implemented by applying microwave signals that rotate the qubit’s quantum state. The frequency, duration, and phase of these pulses determine how the qubit moves on the Bloch sphere.</p>
    <p>The transmon is a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce sensitivity to charge noise, which can cause decoherence. It consists of a Josephson junction shunted by a large capacitor. This design keeps the energy levels of the qubit well-defined and allows for longer coherence times compared to earlier superconducting qubits. In the transmon, the two lowest energy levels, |0⟩ and |1⟩, form the qubit states. Higher energy levels exist but are sufficiently spaced so that microwave pulses can selectively manipulate only the qubit subspace. Transmons are widely used in modern quantum processors because of their relative robustness and scalability.</p>

    <section id="bloch-sphere" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>The Bloch Sphere</h2>
      <p>The Bloch Sphere provides a geometric way to represent all possible pure states of a single qubit. Every point on the surface of the sphere corresponds to a unique qubit state.</p>

<h3>The Axes</h3>
<p>The sphere has an X, Y, and Z axis. The Z-axis represents the computational basis states |0⟩ (north pole) and |1⟩ (south pole). The X and Y axes represent superposition states that differ by their relative phase. The state |0⟩ lies at the top of the sphere, while |1⟩ lies at the bottom. Any other point represents a mixture of these states.</p>

<h3>Phase as Rotation</h3>
<p>Rotation around the Z-axis changes the phase of the qubit without changing measurement probabilities. This phase evolution becomes visible when qubits interact with each other.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="measurement" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>Measurement and Probabilities</h2>
      <h3>Projection onto the Z-Axis</h3>
<p>When a qubit is measured, its state is projected onto the Z-axis of the Bloch sphere. The outcome is always either |0⟩ or |1⟩.</p>

<h3>Measurement Outcomes</h3>
<p>Measurement does not reveal the qubit’s full state. Instead, it produces one of two outcomes probabilistically, even though the state before measurement was continuous.</p>

<h3>Probability from Sphere Coordinates</h3>
<p>The vertical position of the state vector determines the probability of measuring |0⟩ or |1⟩. A state closer to the north pole has a higher probability of yielding |0⟩.</p>

<h3>Collapse on Measurement</h3>
<p>After measurement, the qubit collapses into the measured state. The prior superposition is lost, and repeated measurements will give the same result.</p>

    <section id="two-qubits" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>From One Qubit to Two Qubits</h2>
      <h3>Product States vs Entangled States</h3>
<p>Two qubits can exist in product states, where each qubit behaves independently, or in entangled states, where the system must be described as a whole. A single Bloch sphere cannot represent all information about a two-qubit system. While individual qubit states can still be visualized, their correlations require additional structure.</p>

<p>Mathematically, multi-qubit systems are described using tensor products. Conceptually, this means the total system contains more information than the sum of its parts.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="two-qubit-gates" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>Two-Qubit Gates</h2>
      <h3>Two-Qubit Gates</h3>
<p>Some two-qubit gates use one qubit to control the operation on another (such as CNOT), while others involve exchanging excitations or information between qubits.</p>

<p>Two-qubit gates are responsible for generating entanglement, which is essential for quantum advantage in computation and simulation. Physically, two-qubit gates arise from interactions between qubits mediated by capacitive, inductive, or resonator-based coupling.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="iswap" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>The iSWAP Gate</h2>
     <h3>What iSWAP Does</h3>
<p>The iSWAP gate exchanges the |01⟩ and |10⟩ states while introducing a phase of i. Unlike a simple swap, it uniquely preserves quantum coherence and phase information.</p>

<p>iSWAP naturally emerges from capacitive or inductive coupling between superconducting qubits, making it especially relevant for real hardware implementations.</p>

<h3>Exchange of Excitations</h3>
<p>The gate allows a single excitation to move back and forth between qubits. This exchange is visualized as coordinated motion on each qubit’s Bloch sphere.</p>

<h3>Phase Accumulation</h3>
<p>In addition to swapping populations, iSWAP introduces a relative phase that affects future interference and gate behavior.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="decomposition" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>Decomposing Two-Qubit Gates</h2>
      <h3>Why Decomposition Is Needed</h3>
<p>Many quantum hardware platforms support only a limited set of native gates. To perform arbitrary operations, complex gates must be broken down into simpler ones.</p>

<h3>Single-Qubit Rotations</h3>
<p>Single-qubit gates rotate states around the X, Y, or Z axes of the Bloch sphere. These operations are fast, precise, and widely available.</p>

<h3>Fixed Two-Qubit Interaction (iSWAP)</h3>
<p>By combining single-qubit rotations with a fixed entangling interaction like iSWAP, we can construct any desired two-qubit unitary operation. This ability to decompose any two-qubit gate into smaller operations is what makes a quantum gate set universal.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="kak" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>KAK Decomposition</h2>
      <h3>What is KAK Decomposition?</h3>
<p>The KAK decomposition states that any two-qubit gate can be written as a sequence of single-qubit rotations, followed by a fixed entangling interaction, followed by more single-qubit rotations. This separates a gate into local operations and a purely nonlocal core.</p>

<h3>Local vs Nonlocal Operations</h3>
<p>Single-qubit operations affect each qubit independently and do not create entanglement. The nonlocal component of a two-qubit gate is responsible for entangling the qubits and cannot be decomposed into separate single-qubit actions.</p>

<p>In the KAK framework, the nonlocal part of a two-qubit gate can be written in a standard exponential form involving joint Pauli operators. Different choices of parameters correspond to different types of entangling behavior.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="weyl" class="explain-section" tabindex="-1">
      <h2>The Weyl Section</h2>
     <h3>Weyl Section Overview</h3>
<p>The Weyl section is a way of classifying two-qubit gates by their entangling power alone, ignoring anything that can be changed by single-qubit rotations. Different gates can look different mathematically or experimentally, but are the same in terms of entanglement; the Weyl section allows you to say “these gates are equivalent, even if they’re written differently”.</p>

<p>The Weyl section is a specific triangular region in 3D geometric space that classifies all two-qubit gates based on their nonlocal content. Gates that differ only by single-qubit rotations map to the same point in this space. The Weyl section is the smallest “fundamental region” of the point in 3D space that a two-qubit gate represents.</p>

<p>Each point in the Weyl section corresponds to three parameters that describe how strongly the qubits interact along different axes. These coordinates uniquely define the entangling power of the gate.</p>

<p>Well-known gates such as CNOT, CZ, and iSWAP occupy specific points or lines within the Weyl section. Their relative positions reflect differences in symmetry and entangling strength. The Weyl section allows us to compare two-qubit gates independent of hardware details. If two gates map to the same point, they are equivalent up to single-qubit rotations.</p>

<h3>How This Appears in Our Simulator</h3>
<p>Our simulator uses gate decomposition to show how complex two-qubit operations are built from local rotations and entangling interactions. The animations reflect movement through different types of entanglement classified by the Weyl section.</p>

<h3>Visual Intuition</h3>
<p>Although the Weyl section itself is abstract, its concepts explain why very different-looking gate sequences can produce the same final entanglement. The Bloch-sphere animations make these equivalences visible.</p>
